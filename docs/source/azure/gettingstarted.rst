.. _azure_install-cc:

Install Cloud Custodian and Azure Plugin
----------------------------------------

Cloud Custodian is a Python application and supports Python 2 and 3 on Linux and Windows.
We recommend using Python 3.6 or higher.

The Azure provider is an additional package which is installed in addition to c7n.


Option 1: Install released packages to local Python Environment
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install c7n
    $ pip install c7n_azure


Option 2: Install latest from the repository
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/cloud-custodian/cloud-custodian.git
    $ cd cloud-custodian
    $ pip install -e .
    $ pip install -e tools/c7n_azure


.. _azure_write-policy:

Write your first policy
-----------------------

A policy specifies the following items:

* The type of resource to run the policy against
* Filters to narrow down the set of resources
* Actions to take on the filtered set of resources

For this tutorial we will filter to a VM of a specific name, then add the tag ``Hello: World``.

Create a file named ``custodian.yml`` with this content, and update ``my_vm_name`` to match an existing VM.

*note: Some text editors (VSCode) inject invalid whitespace characters when copy/pasting YAML from a browser*

.. code-block:: yaml

    policies:
        - name: my-first-policy
          description: |
            Adds a tag to a virtual machines
          resource: azure.vm
          filters:
            - type: value
              key: name
              value: my_vm_name
          actions:
           - type: tag
             tag: Hello
             value: World

.. _azure_run-policy:

Run your policy
---------------

First, **choose one of the supported authentication mechanisms** and either log in to Azure CLI or set
environment variables as documented in :ref:`azure_authentication`.

.. code-block:: bash

    custodian run --output-dir=. custodian.yml

If successful, you should see output similar to the following on the command line::

    2016-12-20 08:35:06,133: custodian.policy:INFO Running policy my-first-policy resource: azure.vm
    2016-12-20 08:35:07,514: custodian.policy:INFO policy: my-first-policy resource:ec2 has count:1 time:1.38
    2016-12-20 08:35:08,188: custodian.policy:INFO policy: my-first-policy action: tag: 1 execution_time: 0.67


You should also find a new ``my-first-policy`` directory with a log and other
files (subsequent runs will append to the log by default rather than
overwriting it).

See :ref:`filters` for more information on the features of the Value filter used in this sample.

.. _monitor-azure-cc:

Monitor Azure
-------------

You can generate App Insights metrics by specifying the ``--metrics`` flag and specifying ``azure``::

  $ custodian run -s <output_directory> --metrics azure <policyfile>.yml

You can also upload Cloud Custodian logs to App Insights logs::

  $ custodian run --log-group=azure://cloud-custodian/<dev-account>/<region> -s <output_directory> <policyfile>.yml

And you can output logs and resource records to Azure storage accounts::

  $ custodian run -s azure://<my-bucket><my-prefix> <policyfile>.yml
